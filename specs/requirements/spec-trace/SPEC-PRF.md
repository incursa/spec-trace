# [`SPEC-PRF`](./SPEC-PRF.md) - Conformance Profiles and Enforcement Levels

## Purpose

Define the lightweight conformance profiles that let the standard stay easy on day one while supporting stricter repository policies when stronger traceability is needed.

## Scope

This specification covers the canonical profile names, the checks included in each profile, and the rule that profile choice stays repository-level rather than becoming per-artifact metadata.

## Context

Not every repository wants the same enforcement baseline. Some only need correct shapes and stable identifiers. Others want a stricter trace graph without turning the standard into a certification program.

## [`REQ-PRF-0001`](./SPEC-PRF.md) Define the canonical conformance profiles
The standard MUST define `core`, `traceable`, and `auditable` as its only canonical conformance profiles.

Notes:
- The profiles are ordered from least strict to most strict.
- The profile names are canonical; repositories may add local policy names, but not new canonical profiles.
- Reader-friendly shorthand such as spec-valid, artifact-linked, and evidence-backed may help explanation, but it does not create alternate canonical names.

## [`REQ-PRF-0002`](./SPEC-PRF.md) Keep the core profile minimal
The `core` profile MUST require schema-conformant shape, identifier correctness, and approved normative keyword correctness only.

Notes:
- `core` is the low-burden baseline.
- `core` does not require downstream trace completeness, verification coverage, or reciprocal trace checks.
- In practice, `core` is the spec-valid baseline: the requirements are structurally valid and trustworthy as requirements.

## [`REQ-PRF-0003`](./SPEC-PRF.md) Define the traceable profile as core plus graph hygiene
The `traceable` profile MUST require the `core` profile plus no unresolved artifact or requirement references, no duplicate IDs, and at least one downstream trace link for every requirement.

Notes:
- Downstream trace links are `Satisfied By`, `Implemented By`, and `Verified By`.
- Upstream lineage fields such as `Derived From`, `Supersedes`, and `Source Refs` do not satisfy the downstream-trace requirement by themselves.
- In practice, `traceable` is artifact-linked: every requirement must be connected to at least one downstream artifact.

## [`REQ-PRF-0004`](./SPEC-PRF.md) Define the auditable profile as traceable plus proof coverage
The `auditable` profile MUST require the `traceable` profile plus verification coverage for every requirement, reciprocal trace agreement where reciprocal fields exist, and no orphan ARC, WI, or VER artifacts.

Notes:
- Verification coverage means each requirement has at least one `Verified By` link.
- Reciprocal fields exist when a linked architecture, work item, or verification artifact can mirror the requirement's downstream trace.
- An orphan ARC, WI, or VER artifact is an artifact that is not targeted by any requirement's downstream trace links.
- In practice, `auditable` is evidence-backed: every requirement has verification coverage and the graph is internally consistent.
- `auditable` does not mean formal proof of correctness or certification-style assurance.

## [`REQ-PRF-0005`](./SPEC-PRF.md) Keep profile choice lightweight and repository-scoped
The standard MUST remain usable at `core` level without per-artifact profile fields or certification records.

Notes:
- A repository MAY choose one canonical profile as its local enforcement target.
- Profile choice is repository policy, not canonical artifact metadata.
- Local policy terms such as implemented, verified, and release-ready may be useful inside a repository, but they remain outside the canonical profile set unless the repository standardizes them.

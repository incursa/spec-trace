# SPEC-LAY-0001 - Repository Layout and Artifact Placement

## Purpose

Define how repositories should place source artifacts so the structure reinforces the traceability model.

## Scope

This specification covers the recommended `/specs` tree, placement of artifact families, generated outputs, and the distinction between document role and file naming.

## Context

Traceability weakens when requirements, design, work, and verification are scattered according to workflow noise instead of stable product structure.

## REQ-LAY-0001 Keep live source artifacts under the /specs tree
A repository using the standard MUST keep live source artifacts under `/specs` with dedicated areas for requirements, architecture, decisions, work-items, verification, generated outputs, templates, and schemas.

## REQ-LAY-0002 Organize specifications by stable domain and concern
Specifications MUST be organized by stable domain first and by capability, behavior area, interface, or technical concern second.

## REQ-LAY-0003 Place artifact families according to their role
Architecture, work-item, and verification artifacts MUST live in their respective family areas with traceability back to requirement identifiers.

## REQ-LAY-0004 Keep generated outputs separate from source artifacts
Generated indexes, matrices, and coverage reports MUST live under `/specs/generated` when they are stored in the repository.

## REQ-LAY-0005 Include the full specification ID in specification file names
Each specification file name MUST include the full specification artifact ID.

## REQ-LAY-0006 Keep one specification per Markdown file
Each specification Markdown file MUST contain exactly one specification and one or more related requirement clauses beneath it.

## REQ-LAY-0007 Treat index files as navigation only
A domain or concern MAY include an `_index.md` file for navigation.

## REQ-LAY-0008 Keep the reference package packaging-friendly
The public reference package MUST keep its canonical suite under `specs/requirements/spec-trace/`.

## REQ-LAY-0009 Keep file names stable and readable
Specification file names SHOULD remain stable and readable without using dates, sprints, or owner names.

## REQ-LAY-0010 Keep indexes non-authoritative
An `_index.md` file MUST NOT replace the underlying artifacts.

## REQ-LAY-0011 Allow copy-friendly root guidance in the reference package
The public reference package MAY also publish root guidance and templates for copy convenience.
